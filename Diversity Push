get full list -- DONE

Drop from full list, contacts that have verified race data -- Done but test

Delet records w

insert the leftovers on the full list

Question: Push to master record, or all records in a cluster? -- all recores
Question: how does merging affect these records? the Verified ones should remain

DONT FORGET ABOUT DELETE FLAG ON CONTACTS - CUT DOWN ON ERRORS
